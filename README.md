# Daniele Sinigaglia

I am Software Engineer🐸 in Bosch SensorTech, I studied at the Politecnico di Milano.
My favourite objects are my shoes👞 and my bike🚲 because my hobby is to visit new places and talk to new people by making a strong effort to reach them. 

I prefer to work hard to achieve new skills instead of waiting to someone teach me how to do something.
I love people and I spend many moments with my community in enjoying every moment that God gave us, for example meet my people out of their home (because I live far away from the city centre).
